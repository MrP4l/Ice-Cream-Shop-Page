# Ice-Cream-Shop-Page

Project started with the aim of learning to use Webpack, in progress I thought of making the front end part more pleasant, I also tried to apply for the first time the parallax effect, some scroll transitions and responsiveness with media queries (lately I had used the CLAMP function). In the end, I gave up on scroll transitions, I partially applied the parallax effect and it seems I managed to make it responsive for mobile devices. The page was built using Javascript only and I didn't use any framework except for the hamburger menu icon.
